            <h1>Why Do I Love Classcal Pianio?</h1>
              <p>
                I honestly don't know the answer to this question, 
                neither can I give a reason why classical music in general, and 
                especially classical piano and other piano music touched me so much.
              </p> 
              <p>
                However, I can say that it was my mother who introduced me to my first
                keyboard; It was a toy and a Christmas present when I was around 11-years-old,
                and it couldn't have had more than 20 - 25 keys altogether, and most hilariously, 
                it only produced the tell-tale organ sound. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Evenso, I loved this present and practiced relentlessly to find well-known simple
                songs on this toy instrument, such as the song "Happy Birthday",  "Silent Night", etc.
                There was no Internet during this time, so there was no easy way to learn how to play.
              </p>

              <p>
                I learned the basic C scale with both hands in middle school (I was even the pianist in the school band);
                However, it was only during my High School years my high school experience is complicated
                blind music teacher took an interest in me; this is when I began to become more comfortable and skilled 
                with the piano. It was only when Internet users began uploaded content and creating websites is when I
                able to find out how much I enjoyed classical music.

            <h2>What Does Classical Piano Music Mean to me Now?</h2>  
            <section>
              <p>I wish I did have more time to play and to learn. Unfortunately,
                I do not have that time as 'real-life' is always calling. 
              </p> 

              <p>
                Practicing, learning, and refreshing my piano skills has always been one
                of the ways I was able to decompress and release my negative energy.
